fix(analysis-page): visual design & localization
```

## Body (72 chars per line)
```
Fixed all visual design inconsistencies and missing localization keys
in the Analysis Page. The page now matches the Preprocess Page design
patterns perfectly.

Visual Improvements:
- Added hint buttons (blue theme, 20x20px) to all section headers
- Implemented title bar widgets with hint + action buttons
- Applied consistent label styling (font-weight, colors, sizes)
- Added hover effects to all interactive elements
- Matched spacing and margins with preprocess page

Localization Fixes:
- Added 26 missing translation keys to en.json
- Added 26 Japanese translations to ja.json
- Fixed all localization warnings (26+ → 0)
- Added quick_stats_hint discovered during testing

Implementation Verification:
- Verified all analysis_page_utils modules complete (100%)
- Confirmed all 14 analysis methods implemented
- Tested application launch (SUCCESS)
- No critical errors or missing keys

Files Modified:
- assets/locales/en.json (26 keys added)
- assets/locales/ja.json (26 translations added)
- pages/analysis_page.py (5 sections styled)
- .docs/pages/analysis_page.md (updated)
- .AGI-BANKS/RECENT_CHANGES.md (documented)

Testing:
✅ Application launches successfully
✅ No localization warnings
✅ Visual consistency with preprocess page
✅ All hint buttons working with tooltips
✅ All analysis_page_utils modules verified

Design Patterns Documented:
- Hint button pattern (blue theme, hover effects)
- Title bar widget pattern (title + hint + actions)
- Action button pattern (transparent, hover #e7f3ff)
- Label styling hierarchy (primary 13px/600, secondary 11px/500)

Impact:
- User Experience: Consistent, professional UI with helpful tooltips
- Code Quality: Design patterns documented and reusable
- Maintainability: Comprehensive documentation in .AGI-BANKS and .docs
- Localization: Complete coverage, zero warnings

Status: 🎉 FULLY COMPLETE 🎉
